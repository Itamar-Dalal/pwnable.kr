Explantion:
In the source code, the dumbass who created it wrote this function:

int betting() //Asks user amount to bet
{
 printf("\n\nEnter Bet: $");
 scanf("%d", &bet);
 
 if (bet > cash) //If player tries to bet more money than player has
 {
        printf("\nYou cannot bet more money than you have.");
        printf("\nEnter Bet: ");
        scanf("%d", &bet);
        return bet;
 }
 else return bet;
} // End Function

You can clearly see that it checks only one time if the bet is greater then the cash (he needed to use while loop), so if I write 1000000 twice it will be ok and give me the flag.
